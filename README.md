## Methodology  
The model uses explainable rules based on:  
- Transaction amount  
- Transactions per month  
- Country risk level  
- Cash transaction indicator  

## Outputs  
- Final dataset with risk scores: AML_Risk_Scoring_Output.csv  
- Risk category bar chart  
- Risk score distribution histogram  

## Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Spyder IDE
